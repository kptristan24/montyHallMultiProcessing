I made this dumb thing to practice multiprocessing in python and test the monty hall problem. Funny enough, since not much computing is actually being done per thread it actually adds more time per core you allocate for this program.

But anyway, mission accomplished. See ya later nerds.

usage: python montyHall.py \<number of trial\> \<number of cores\>

If you don't know what you're doing with the cores, just put 1. Not my problem if you pipe yourself with this shitbird.
